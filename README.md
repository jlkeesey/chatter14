# Chatter14

Provides a way to extract Final Fantasy XIV chat conversations from an Advanced Combat
Tracker (ACT) log. ACT is often used to view information about combat but it also extracts
all of the chat logs as well. However these chat logs are interspersed with all kinds of
other information about actions happening in the environment around your character. This
makes reading a conversation difficult. And if you are having multiple separate
conversations at the same time these conversations are interspersed.

This app will extract chats from the ACT logs and will further strip out all but a single
group of people that you define. It can also, optionally include all of the emotes that
were used between the members of the group as many conversations occur almost entirely
through emotes.
